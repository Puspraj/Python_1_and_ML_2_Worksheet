Subjective Question answer

10> Answer:- The adjusted R-squared penalize you for adding independents variables that 
             do not fit in models.Some of those variables will be significant but you can't
             be sure the significant is just by chance.
           - The adjusted compensate for this by that penalizing you for those extra variables.

11> Answer:- Ridge and Lasso both are the regression model. Ridge regularizatin in use for L2-
             regression where Lasso is use for L1-regression. In the Ridge regression the penalty
             is the sum of squares of the coefficients, where Lasso, it's sum of the absolute values
             of the coefficients.

12>Answer:- Variable inflatio factor(VIF) is a measure of the ammout of the multicollinearity in a 
            set of multiple regression variables.Sutable values of VIF is 6-7 for a feature ot be 
            included in a regression modeling.

13>Answer:- Scale or StandardScaler is needed before feeding it to the train the model because, it 
            basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range. Sometime it also use 
            to speed up the calculations in the algorithum.

14>Answer:- Different regression metrics in linear regression is mean absolute error,mean squared error,
            and square root of mean absolute error.Goodness of fit in general, refers to measuring the
            observed data correspond ot fitted model.

15>Answer:- precision= 1000/1000+250 =0.8
            recall=  1000/1000+50  = 0.95
            accuracy= 1000+1200/1000+1200+250+50 = 0.88
            specificity= 1200/1200+250 = 0.827
